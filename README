        Overview
        --------
        'rio' is a simple command line utility which allows
        you to display and manage files on your Diamond Rio
        portable music player.

        At present the Rio utility supports the Diamond Rio PMP300
        with 32M internal flash memory.
        Additional external flash memory is now supported thanks to
        the work done by Guido March (march@pc40.mpier.uni-frankfurt.de).

        command line switches available :-

        -d  display directory
        -iy initialize with check for bad blocks
        -in initialize without check for bad blocks
        -x  perform operations on external flash ram
        -u  specify file to upload
        -g  specify file to download
        -f  specify text based playlist file which contains files to be upload
        -z  specify file to delete
        -za delete all files
        -o  specify new playlist order in quotes
        -p  specify parallel port base IO address, default=0x378
        -v  enable verbose mode

        examples...

        ; display directory using parallel port at 0x278
                rio -p 0x278 -d
        ; initialize (with bad block check) and upload file
                rio -iy -u song.mp3
        ; delete existing files and upload playlist onto external flash ram
                rio -za -f playlist.txt -x
        ; initialize, upload files in playlist and then display directory
                rio -d -in -f playlist.txt
        ; download file then delete it and finally display directory
                rio -d -g mp3Files/song.mp3 -z song.mp3
        ; reverse playlist order and then display directory
                rio -o "5 4 3 2 1" -d

        Initialization
        --------------
        Initialization should only be performed on new or corrupt cards.
        You can initialize with bad block checking enabled (-iy) which
        will test all blocks on the internal or external flash ram (which
        ever is selected) and note all bad blocks. This process will
        take some time (upto 20 minutes on slow machines).
        You can also initialize with bad block checking disabled (-in)
        which is much quicker but all blocks (even bad blocks) will
        be used.

        If you want to delete all files on the device, the (-za) option
        should be used instead of using the initialization options
        mentioned above.

        Building and running
        --------------------

                Linux, GCC
                ----------
                To build and run the application you must be
                logged on as root, then use 'make'.
                (rio utility has been built and tested
                using gcc compiler v2.7.2.3 under Linux v2.0.34)

                Windows NT v4.0, Visual C++ v5
                ------------------------------
                Use 'nmake /fwinnt.mak'.
                (rio utility has been built and tested using
                MS Visual C++ compiler v5 under
                Windows Workstation NT 4.0)

                Windows 95/98, Visual C++ v5
                ----------------------------
                Use 'nmake /fwin9x.mak'.
                (rio utility has been built and tested
                using MS Visual C++ compiler v5 under Windows 98)

                DOS, Borland Turbo C++ v1.01
                ----------------------------
                Use 'make -fdos.mak'
                (rio utility has been built and tested
                using Borland Turbo C++ v1.01 under DOS v6.22 and
                Windows 98).

        Known Bugs
        ----------
        Because of the difference in timings between different machines
        it is possible that you may experience problems when downloading
        and displaying the directory.
        If you encounter this problem try one or both of the following...

                Try doubling the value of IODELAY_1 and/or IODELAY_2
                #define's in mpm.cpp. This will only increase the time
                it takes to download and will not have an effect on
                file upload times.

                Use the utility when the device is powered on as this
                seems to improve IO performance.

        Bug Reports
        -----------
        If you encounter any problems using this utility please send
        e-mail outlining the problem along with details about your
        Rio (memory installed, memory remaining and tracks loaded) to...
